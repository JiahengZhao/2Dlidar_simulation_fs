# 2Dlidar_simulation_fs

Jiaheng Zhao, Tiancheng Li



This is a simulation code in MATLAB. It can generate laser points hit on the irregular features when the robot moves. The irregular feature is generated by Fourier series.  The generated data is used in the Manuscript "2D Laser SLAM with Closed Shape Features: Fourier Series Parameterization and Submap Joining" in ICRA 2021.
